In C++, the virtual keyword is used to declare a member function as virtual in a base class. When a member function is declared as virtual, it allows derived classes to override that function with their own implementation.

Here's what you need to know about virtual functions:

Virtual functions enable polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different derived classes to be treated as objects of the base class. When a base class function is declared as virtual and a derived class overrides that function, the appropriate derived class implementation is called based on the actual object type during runtime.

Late binding: Virtual functions use dynamic or late binding, which means that the function to be called is determined at runtime based on the actual object type, rather than the type of the pointer or reference used to access the object.

Override in derived classes: When a derived class wants to override a virtual function from the base class, it must use the override keyword in the derived class declaration. This helps ensure that the function is actually overriding a base class virtual function and not just overloading it.

In the provided code, the makeSound() function is declared as virtual in the Animal base class. This allows the makeSound() functions in the Dog and Cat classes to override it with their own implementations.

By using the virtual keyword and providing different implementations for the makeSound() function in the derived classes, we achieve the desired behavior where dogs bark and cats meow when the makeSound() function is called.

Note: The destructor in C++ is automatically called in the reverse order of construction, so when the base class destructor is declared as virtual (as in the code provided), it ensures that the derived class destructor is also called when deleting an object through a base class pointer or reference.
